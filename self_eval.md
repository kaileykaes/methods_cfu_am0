# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- I think If I sleep on it, I'll feel pretty confident of my use of built-in Ruby methods. I'm not the person to ask about my feelings at this time. 
2.  How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- I feel pretty confident writing simple methods of my own because I really spent a lot of time with broken code. Now that it's fixed, I know exactly how it works. 
3. What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
How do you create your own .method?
